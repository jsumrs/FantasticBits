### Rules
Score more points than your opponent.  
Two players face off in a rectangular map.  
Each player controls 2 wizards. To score a point, a Snaffle (a mix between a Snitch and a Quaffle) must go through the opponent's goal  

### Ranking
My bot ranked into Gold league which is the second highest league.  
The leagues go as follows: Wood 2 -> Wood 1 -> Bronze -> Silver -> Gold -> Legend
I made it to gold with the following strategy:
 * Flipendo any snaffles in a straight line to the goal.
 * Accio snaffles that are between my goal and my wizard.
 * Petrify fast moving snaffles that are near my goal's line.
 * If not holding snaffle, move to nearest one.
 * If holding snaffle, throw toward goal.
